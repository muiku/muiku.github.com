description: Introductory post. How this blog was created and why to start following it.

This is [Muiku Oy](http://www.muiku.com)'s official blog. I crafted this blog up when experimenting with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [initializer-template](http://verekia.com/initializr/responsive-template). Jekyll offers nice way to separate posts from the layout and other content. The possibility to derive layouts from other layouts was also something I felt in love (and of course Jekyll was suitably geek). In addition I was decided that I want to host our blog in GitHub pages, which also has nice Jekyll support.

The template is based on initializer-template. It represents the responsive web design (RWB), which I considered important for a blog. I wanted that the blog will render nicely in wide range of devices, from smart phones and tablets to wide screen monitors. If you want to study our blog's technology more closely, fork my [ghblog-template](https://github.com/kblomqvist/ghblog-template).

Why to start following us?
--------------------------

If you are interested in technology in general, like messing around with things and possibly are entrepreneur, you are likely going to find interesting read here. I have plans to blog about all kind of development we are going throw. That is web application development (Zend Framework, Django), embedded hardware design and programming (proto boards, C/C++). In the next few days I am going to expose our very first product, which I think will be awesome -- cannot wait to get tell it ...

(Of course the blog theme need to be polished too ;)
